      <i><b>You Want It Darker</b></i> is the fourteenth and final studio album
      by Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, released on October 16, 2016,
      by Columbia Records, nineteen days before Cohen's death. The album was
      created towards the end of his life and focuses on death, God, and humor.
      It was released to critical acclaim. The title track was awarded a Grammy
      Award for Best Rock Performance in January 2018.

      After touring extensively between 2008 and 2013, Leonard Cohen began to
      suffer "multiple fractures of the spine" among other physical problems,
      according to his son Adam Cohen. Due to Leonard Cohen's mobility issues,
      <i>You Want It Darker</i> was recorded in the living room of his home in
      Mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles and then sent by e-mail to his musical
      collaborators.

      Cohen has said his condition helped him eliminate any distractions during
      the recording of the album: "In a certain sense, this particular
      predicament is filled with many fewer distractions than other times in my
      life and actually enables me to work with a little more concentration and
      continuity than when I had duties of making a living, being a husband,
      being a father". Despite his medical condition, Adam Cohen said his father
      "Occasionally, in bouts of joy, he would even, through his pain, stand up
      in front of the speakers, and we'd repeat a song over and over like
      teenagers".

      Musically, the album is "a little bit more sparse and acoustic" compared
      to his recent albums, according to Adam Cohen. Blues dominate the album.
